          <h2 class="sl-about-subheading">What is it?</h2>
          <p class="sl-about-description">
            Sharedlist is a yet another simple checklist app that allows you to
            create and share checklists with others without signing up or
            logging in. You can choose between read only sharing or allow the
            people to modify the checklist when you share with read and write
            permissions.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sl-about-subheading">How to use it?</h2>
          <p class="sl-about-description">
            Simply replace the heading with you desired checklist name and press
            enter on your keyboard. Please note pressing enter is the only way
            to enter new items in you checklist. Once you are done click save
            button to save the checklist. Use my checklist button to view your
            saved checklists. You can share your checklist by clicking the share
            button below the checklist. Just choose permissions and copy the
            link to share with others. Similarly you can delete your checklist
            by clicking the delete.
          </p>
          <p class="sl-about-description">
            Important Note: you can delete or share checklists that are shared
            with you by other users. However, you can edit them if the other
            person has provide you with read and write permissions.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sl-about-subheading">Word of caution</h2>
          <p class="sl-about-description">
            Since the app doesnt require you to sign up or log in, your
            anonymous id is store in your browser, hence you can only access
            your checklists from the browser you used initially. Also if you
            clear your browser data, you will lose all your checklists. So
            please be careful. In future I will add functionality to bookmark
            your checklists so you can have access to them even if you clear
            your browser data and across devices.
          </p>
